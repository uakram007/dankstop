<p id="110"><strong style="color: #008000; font-size: medium;">Shipping FAQ:</strong></p>
<p id="111"><strong style="font-size: small;">How much is Shipping?</strong> We offer FREE shipping on ALL US orders. Average delivery time for free shipping is 3 days, but depending on your location may take up to 6 business days. Faster shipping methods are available for purchase, as well as international shipping.</p>
<div id="HMIS">
<p>99% of orders are shipped within 24 hours. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee delivery dates or times. We do all in our power to get your items to you as quickly as possible, but orders can be held up due to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>If we could hand deliver each item to your door, we would, but unfortunately that’s impossible.</p>
</div>
<p id="112"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Do you offer discreet shipping?</strong></span></p>
<p>Yes. All orders are shipped in unmarked brown boxes, or white USPS priority boxes. The return address name is DS SHIPPING.</p>
<p id="113"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Do you require a signature on your packages?</strong></span></p>
<p>We reserve the right to require a signature on any order at our discretion due to security concerns. If you are underage, DO NOT order with us. We take fraud and underage orders very seriously, and are obligated to report all credit card fraud to the authorities. DO NOT ORDER IF YOU ARE UNDERAGE. WE WILL FLAG YOUR ORDER.</p>
<p id="114"><strong>How can I check if my order has shipped?</strong></p>
<p>Go to My Account, and click on Order Status. Awaiting Fulfillment means the order is still processing. It’ll say “Shipped” with a link to track your package as soon as it’s shipped.</p>
<p id="115"><strong>When will my order ship?</strong></p>
<p>Orders placed before 2pm EST are shipped same day. All orders are shipped within 24 hours unless otherwise stated on the product page.</p>
<p id="116"><strong>How do I edit or cancel an item in my order?</strong></p>
<p>Give us a call at 844-326-5786 or email support@dankstop.com as soon as possible. Once your order has been packed, it cannot be modified.</p>
<p id="117"><strong>How do I track my order?</strong></p>
<p>Log into your account at DankStop.com. Click “My Account” and go to “Order Status.” Scroll down to the “Tracking Info” section of the page and click on the tracking number.</p>
<p id="118"><strong>My order never arrived. What do I do?</strong></p>
<p>First, check the tracking. If it’s still in transit, just wait until they deliver it. If it says “Delivered” and it hasn’t arrived, please contact your post office with the tracking number.</p>
<p id="119"><strong>An item is missing from my shipment. What do I do?</strong></p>
<p>Call us at 844-326-5786 or email us at support@dankstop.com within 72 hours of receiving your order.</p>
<p id="120"><strong>What is your mailing address?</strong></p>
<p>Our mailing and return address is: DS SHIPPING PO BOX 771 South Plainfield, NJ 07080</p>
<p id="121"><strong>How do you ship your packages?</strong></p>
<p>Hand Pipes are shipped via USPS First Class mail. Larger items such as water pipes, bubblers, etc. are shipped via USPS Priority 1-3 day or Fedex Ground.</p>
<p id="122"><strong>Where do you ship from?</strong></p>
<p>We ship out of South Plainfield, NJ.</p>
<p id="1233"><strong>What if my order breaks during shipping?</strong></p>
<p>We package all orders using a proprietary system we’ve developed to prevent 99.7% of breakage during shipping. However, no one’s perfect, and mistakes may rarely occur. In the unlikely event your item arrives broken, DO NOT throw away the box or packing materials. We will need CLEAR photos of the broken items as well as the box in order to file a claim with the shipping provider (USPS, FedEx).</p>
<p>Depending on the extent of the damage, we may issue a return-shipping label, or simply tell you to toss the broken item in the trash. In either case, a brand new replacement item will be sent out to you.</p>
<p id="12444"><strong>What will my package look like?</strong></p>
<p>Your package will arrive in a brown or white box. More valuable items will have FRAGILE stickers on them. The box will not say DankStop anywhere.</p>
<p id="1255"><strong>Can I have my order shipped to another address other than the one listed on my billing information?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The billing address is only used to verify the credit card information. However, we may request ID verification if the order is going to a different name than the one on the credit card in order to prevent fraudulent orders with stolen credit cards, as well as underage orders.</p>
<p>If you use an American Express card to pay, your order MUST be sent to the billing address. This is only for orders paid via American Express.</p>
<p id="1266"><strong>What if I need to update or change my shipping information?</strong></p>
<p>Contact us by phone (844) 326-5786 or email support@dankstop.com ASAP. Once your order is shipped the destination cannot be changed.</p>

<p id="144"><strong>I cannot complete my transaction because of an “AVS Mismatch” or “Gateway error”. What does this mean?</strong></p>
<p>DankStop provides our clients with a very strict and secure checkout system to ensure each purchase is authentic and non-fraudulent. If you did not receive an order invoice number, then your attempted transaction was rejected. The "AVS Mismatch" or "Gateway Error" is a direct result of incorrect or mismatched billing information being used to complete the purchase.</p>
<p id="145"><strong>What can I do to correct and resolve the “AVS mismatch” or “Gateway error”?</strong></p>
<p>The billing information you entered for your order has to absolutely match the information your credit or debit card company has on file for you. Street address, phone number and email address have to be perfectly matched for the transaction to go through successfully. Use only standard abbreviations such as “St, Ter, Ct, Blvd or Ave.” Any variations in billing information from what your card issuer has on record for your account will be rejected as a failed transaction. Each failed transaction attempt will result in a temporary pending charge to the listed account used. The account will never be charged the pending amount and all pending charges will take up to 24 hours to be released from the account. We highly recommend contacting your Bank or Credit Card Company to confirm all information is accurate before placing your order. If you are required to update your information with your card company, it will take 24 hours for the new billing information to be confirmed in the national database.</p>
<p> </p>
<p id="146"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #008000;"><strong>Returns/Exchanges FAQ:</strong></span></p>
<p id="147"><strong>How do I return my product?</strong></p>
<p>You may return UNUSED products within 7 days or your purchase if they do not meet your requirements. First, contact us for an RMA number. Returns will not be accepted without an RMA number. Next, carefully package your items the same way they arrived. Be sure that all glass items are completely surrounded and cocooned with bubble wrap and packing peanuts. In the event a return comes back to us broken, no refund will be issued until a USPS claim is filed and paid out.</p>
<p id="148"><strong>Does DankStop accept USED PRODUCTS to be returned or exchanged?</strong></p>
<p>No. We absolutely 100% WILL NOT accept used product returns. If it looks or smells like it was used, it will be thrown out immediately and no refund will be issued. There are no exceptions to this policy.</p>
<p id="149"><strong>I received the wrong product.</strong></p>
<p>If you received the wrong product(s), give us a call within 48 hours of receiving your package. DO NOT USE THE ITEMS. If you use the items, we cannot replace them. Once you contact us, our team will decide whether to issue a return shipping label and have you send the item back, or let you keep it and send you the correct item.</p>
<p id="149_2"><strong>What is your return policy?</strong></p>
<p>We understand the frustration of receiving something you ordered online and not being happy with it. To help alleviate your hesitancy to shop online, we offer a 7 day guarantee on UNUSED items. If you are unhappy with your item, let us know and we'll issue a refund. All preference based returns are subject to a 15% restocking fee OR the option to receive store credit for the full amount of your order. Just contact us, get an RMA# and send it back. After 7 days, returns are subject to a 25% restocking fee. Customers are responsible for shipping fees on return items if the return is due to preference. If there was a mistake in the order or an item came broken, we will cover the cost of the return shipping.</p>
<p id="150"><strong>How do I contact you?</strong></p>
<p>We try to make it super easy to get a hold of us. If it’s a question about your order, you can fill out our contact us form, email us at support@dankstop.com, or call us at (844) 326-5786. If you have questions about an item, the following contact methods are available:</p>

<p id="152"><strong>What if I do not like my item(s) and want to return the items for an exchange?</strong></p>
<p>No problem. Contact us by phone or email to set up an exchange. We will issue an RMA number and have you send the item(s) back. If the item you’d like instead is of a greater value, just pay the difference. If it’s of a lesser value, we’ll pay you the difference!</p>
<p id="153"><strong>How long does it take for a refund to be returned to my account?</strong></p>
<p>Refunds should appear in your account in 1-3 business days. This mostly depends on your banks policy.</p>
<p id="154"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #008000;"><strong>Product FAQ:</strong></span></p>
<p id="155"><strong>Are the photos the actual pipes for sale?</strong></p>
<p>All of our photos are taken of actual products from our inventory. Please understand that all of our products are hand made by human artists, and as such may have minor variations in size, shape, or color from the ones pictured. Any variations are minimal, aesthetic, and will never affect functionality. If one of our manufactures changes a product enough that it’s very different from the previous ones, we will take new photos and edit the product listing.</p>
<p id="156"><strong>When do you restock your products?</strong></p>
<p>As soon as we are running low on a product, an order is placed with the manufacturer to restock our inventory. As soon as the order arrives, it goes through quality control and the stock is updated on our site.</p>
<p id="157"><strong>What if I want an item that’s out of stock?</strong></p>
<p>Please go to the product listing for the item you wish to purchase. Right above the SOLD OUT button, please enter your email and click “Notify me when this product is back in stock.” This will ensure you get an email notification as soon as the product is back in stock.</p>
<p id="158"><strong>How does the free gift offer work?</strong></p>
<p>We offer free gifts with every order over $50. You can pick a free gift manually from our free gifts category. If you do not pick one, our staff will pick a free gift for you at random.</p>
<p id="159"><strong>How will I know when items I want will be back in stock?</strong></p>
<p>Go to the product page you'd like to buy. Right above the SOLD OUT button, please enter your email and click “Notify me when this product is back in stock.” This will ensure you get an email notification as soon as the product is back in stock.</p>
<p id="160"><strong>Does DankStop price match any other glass distributors?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! We take pride in offering the best prices in the industry. If at any time you find one of our products cheaper somewhere else, let us know and we’ll beat their price by 5%.</p>
<p id="161"><strong>How can I find out correct size information I need for a particular product I want to purchase?</strong></p>
<p>Every product has a little chart explaining Joint Type and Height right next to the image (or below the image on mobile devices). If you have any questions about sizing, do not hesitate to contact us. Our team will be glad to help.</p>
<p id="162"><strong>I've looked all over the Internet and I just can't believe how cheap you are! How???</strong></p>
<p>We are an online only retailer with no physical store. The reduced overhead costs of not having a retail store combined with our sales volume allow us to offer products at prices well below our competitors. It’s simple: We pay less, you pay less.</p></div></div>
